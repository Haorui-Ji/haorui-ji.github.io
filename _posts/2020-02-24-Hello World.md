Hi, everyone~ My name is Haorui Ji, you can also call me Jerry, this is my first Blog. 

Blogs are very useful for someone to show some recent works, present innovative ideas, and most importantly, to record his life, whether academic activities or experience, daily interesting stories, or maybe just some random thoughts.

Creating a blog under the GitHub Pages should be really easy by introducing some static site generator like “Jekyll”, which is mentioned by someone else. However, I'm totally unfamiliar with this framework so I just get lazy download a template directly from [BY Blog](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io), thank him so much for his generosity~

There are a lot of stuff that requires attention as well as  improvements, and this is only the first step of Jerry's Blog. I'm looking forward to the day that this Blog can really produce something and I'm also hoping that you can like my Blog if I'm lucky enough to have your visit here.
